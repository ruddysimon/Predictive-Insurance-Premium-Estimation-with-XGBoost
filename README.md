# Insurance Pricing Forecast using Ensemble Method (XGBoost Model)
 ---
 
**Problem Statement:**

The primary objective for insurance companies is to maintain profitability by collecting higher premiums than the amount paid to insured individuals who raise valid claims. Accurately predicting healthcare costs is essential to achieving this goal. Using machine learning, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns between features and healthcare costs, as manually identifying these relationships can be both challenging and time-consuming.

 **How will we evaluate our model? What does success look like?**
 
Before initiating a machine learning project, it is crucial to define the metrics used to evaluate the model. In this scenario, we are dealing with a regression problem where we aim to predict a continuous variable (healthcare costs). We will use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as our primary evaluation metric since it effectively penalizes large prediction errors, aiding in the development of a more generalizable model. Additionally, we will assess other metrics during the model training process to gain a comprehensive understanding of our model's performance.

 **Action Plan** 
 
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify potential relationships between variables.
- Develop and evaluate a baseline linear model as a starting point for comparison with more advanced models.
- Improve upon the baseline linear model by incorporating feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and experimenting with different algorithms.
- Present the results and model performance statistics to non-technical stakeholders in an easily comprehensible manner.
